    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! I’m Jonathan. I’m a software engineer living and working in Boston, Massachusetts. I've spent the last three years working with a team of stellar engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver a beautiful product experience for <a href="http://wistia.com" target='_blank'>Wistia</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’ve worked on</h2>
    <p>
      I worked on a ton of projects I was proud of at Wistia. While I was there, I
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>overhauled a customer bandwidth tracker that accounted for up to 30% of company revenue, making it transparent, tested, and reliable. It's been scaling without issue for over two years.</li>
      <li>developed an internal style library so that future developers could use ready-made, flexible UI elements to speed up their projects.</li>
      <li>helped plan and execute the migration of several of our core features (our video player and customizer) into consistent, tested, React/Redux applications.</li>
      <li>took our video captioning system multi-lingual, adding support for more than 80 languages to our player, along with a tool to manage, edit, and order transcriptions.</li>
      <li>provided engineering support and product advisement to a cross-functional team focused on increasing customer adoption rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to my engineering work, I also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>created technical challenges, interviewed, and help to decide on
      engineering candidates, many of whom became close collaborators
      during my time there.</li>
      <li>co-founded and co-chaired Diverstia, Wistia's employee-led diversity and inclusion initiative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Side Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I also volunteer with the <a href="http://progcode.org" target='_blank'>Progressive Coders Network</a>, a nationwide group of programmers, designers, and others who work together to support progressive advocacy initiatives around the United States. Most recently, I've been bootstrapping a <a href="http://github.com/jonathantr/ked-recruiter" target='_blank'>call tool</a> (React frontend, Rails API backend, deployed with Docker) for a canvassing group called Knock Every Door.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also created <a href='https://typedash.xyz' target='_blank'>Typedash</a> to motivate myself and some friends to sit down and just write (I write short stories in my spare time). One friend said of Typedash, and I quote, "I finished my MFA thesis on it." So there's that.
    </p>

    <h2>Things I'm good at</h2>
    </p>
      <em>Technical:</em> I started out as a Ruby developer, but the front end is where I really find my flow. Still, I'm always down to jump on a back end challenge and more recently I've been dipping my toes into the DevOps waters for some of my volunteer projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Non-technical:</em> I love direct collaboration and I especially dig pair programming. I also really enjoy helping to develop and refine product decisions from an engineering perspective.
    <p>

    <h2>What I’m looking to do next</h2>
    <p>
      Right now I'm looking for companies with a strong social mission and a deep culture of collaboration, mentorship, and personal growth. If that's you, I'd love to <a href="mailto:jonathan.d.reilly@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.
