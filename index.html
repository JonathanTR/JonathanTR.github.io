    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I've spent the last three years working with a team of stellar engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver a beautiful product experience for our video hosting customers at Wistia.
    </p>

    <h3>What I’ve worked on</h3>
    <p>
      I worked on a ton of projects I was proud of at Wistia. Here are some highlights:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I overhauled a customer bandwidth tracker that accounted for up to 30% of company revenue, making it transparent, tested, and reliable. It's been scaling without issue for over two years.</li>
      <li>I collaborated with designers and other engineers to develop an internal style library so that future developers could use ready-made, flexible UI elements to speed up their projects.</li>
      <li>I helped plan and execute the migration of one of our major features (our video player customizer) into consistent, tested, React/Redux application, and also contributed to migrating our video player into a similar Preact/Redux application.</li>
      <li>I took our video captioning system multi-lingual, adding support for more than 80 languages to our player, along with a tool to manage, edit, and order video transcriptions. </li>
      <li>I provided engineering support and product advisement to a cross-functional team focused on increasing customer adoption rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Outside of direct coding work, I also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Created technical challenges, interviewed, and help to decide on
      engineering candidates, many of whom became close collaborators
      during my time there.</li>
      <li>Co-founded and co-chaired Diverstia, Wistia's employee-led diversity and inclusion initiative, where we hosted speakers, movie nights, and lunch discussions, while also working with the executive team to develop policies and initiatives that would help the company become more attractive to the widest possible range of candidates. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Side Projects</h3>
    <p>
      On the side, I volunteer with the Progressive Coder's network, a nationwide group of programmers, designers, and others who work together to support progressive advocacy initiatives around the country. Most recently, I've been bootstrapping a call tool (React frontend, Rails API backend, deployed with Docker on Digital Ocean) for a canvassing group called Knock Every Door.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also wrote Typedash.xyz to motivate myself and some friends to sit down and just write (I do short stories in my spare time). One friend said of Typedash, and I quote, "I finished my MFA thesis on it."
    </p>

    <h3>Things I'm good at</h3>
    <p>
      Non-technical: I love direct collaboration. Pair programming is my jam. I also really enjoy helping to develop and refine product decisions with an engineering perspective. I also just love learning new things.
    <br/>
      Technical: I started out as a Ruby developer, but the front end is where I really find my flow. That said, I'm always down to jump on a back end challenge and more recently I've been dipping my toes into the DevOps waters for some of my volunteer projects.
    </p>

    <h3>What I’m looking to do next</h3>

    <p>
      Right now I'm looking for companies with a strong social mission and a deep culture of collaboration, mentorship, and personal growth. If that's you, I'd love to get in touch.
