    <h4>Hi,</h4>
    
    <p>
      My name is Jonathan Turnbull-Reilly and I love coding. When I say that I love coding, I mean that wading into a complex problem without an apparent solution and breaking it down into simple, modular pieces, and then solving and reassembling those pieces lights up the dopamine centers in my brain like a Christmas tree. I recently had the time of my life completing Dev Bootcamp, a web development training program where I spent over 900 hours in 9 weeks accelerating my rate of learning and building a solid foundation in the Rails stack.
    </p>
    
    <h4>You should know that I care about people, a lot.</h4>
      
      <p>
        In my opinion, coding is primarily a tool for connecting and communicating with other people. 

        That shapes the ideals that I strive for as a programmer:
        <li><strong>TDD: </strong>I believe in writing code that is easily maintainable and preserves the sanity of my fellow programmers as well as my future self.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Agile Development:</strong> I believe in start small,  deploying early, and creating features users actually want.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Pay strict attention to imputs and outputs. Wherever possible, write code that fits together like lengths of garden hose.
        </li>
      </p>

    <h4>These are some of my Projects:</h4>
