    <h4>Hi,</h4>
    
    <p>
      My name is Jonathan Turnbull-Reilly and I love coding. When I say that I love coding, I mean that wading into a complex problem without an apparent solution and breaking it down into simple, modular pieces, and then solving and reassembling those pieces lights up the dopamine centers in my brain like a Christmas tree. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently had the time of my life completing Dev Bootcamp, a web development training program where I spent over 1000 hours in 9 weeks accelerating my rate of learning and building a solid foundational knowledge of Ruby on Rails and its surrounding ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h4>These are some of the things I've been working on:</h4>
    <h5><a href="http://getessence.herokuapp.com">Essence</a></h5>

    <p>
      <em>
      Essence is a web application that allows users to extract snippets of text from PDF files and associate them with personalized topics to organize their learning. It provides a layer of personal meaning between recalled information and source content. Snippets also link back to their sources, allowing users to review their information in its original context.

    <h5><a href="http://www.jonathantr.com/Conways_Game">Conway's Interactive Game of Life</a></h5>

    <p>
      <em>
      The idea here was to tackle Conway's game in vanilla JavaScript. As a bonus, the user can seed the board themselves, start and stop the game, and time how long their colony survives. They can even play god and insert living cells into the board during gameplay.
