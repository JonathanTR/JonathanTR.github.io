    <h1>Hi,</h1>
    <p>
      Thanks for visiting my site. I'm Jonathan Turnbull-Reilly, but you can call me JTR. I am a full-stack, junior developer working primarily in Rails and Sinatra.
    </p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>What I care about</h3>
      <p>
        I care about people, first and foremost. In my opinion, coding is primarily a tool for connecting and communicating with people.

        That said, there are a few values I hold as a programmer:
        <li><strong>TDD: </strong>I want to write code that is easily maintainable and preserves the sanity of my fellow programmers.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Development:</strong> Start small. Deploy early. Create features users actually want.</li>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Pay strict attention to imputs and outputs. Write code that </li>

      </p>
    <h3>Things I've done for money</h3>
    <p>
      I have been:
      <ul>
        <li>A barista</li>
        <li>An overnight hotel manager</li>
        <li>A finder of warehouse things</li>
        <li>A James Dean look-alike (it's the hair)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>What I want to do</h3>
    <h3>Why should I work with you?</h3>
